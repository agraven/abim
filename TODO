* fix/actually implement window-resizing
* rework how textures are loaded, probably by implementing a key/value texture database
* add wrapper function for handling filenames
* add shortcut-functions for rendering simple geometry
* distinguish static/scene object and moving objects
* maybe rework objects to have list of points rather than position and size

Long term:
* implement menu toolkit
* implement physics (using Box2D?)
